## About Me

I'm Hugo, a ML Researcher in Machine Learning at ETH Zürich. I just defended my thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Gunnar Rätsch](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/people/person/gunnar-raetsch) as part of the [Biomedical Informatics lab (BMI)](https://bmi.inf.ethz.ch/). My main area of research focus on advancing deep learning methods for event detection in multivariate time series. I work on healthcare application around patient monitoring in the Intensive care unit (ICU).
